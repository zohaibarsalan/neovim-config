# NeoVim Configuration

I use NeoVim btw

This neovim (nvim) config has been made after referencing multiple different nvim configs from different creators and users most notably theprimeagen and josean. Morever, I referenced multiple distros of nvim aswell and in the end came up with the perfect nvim config for me.

## File Structure

```
-> lua
    -> zohaib (username)
        -> core
            -- init.lua
            -- keymaps.lua
            -- options.lua

        -> plugins
        -- lazy.lua
    -- init.lua
```
